This June, I had the chance to attend the ESA Living Planet Symposium 2025 in Vienna, an every 3 years conference which gathers scientists, engineers, strategists, and enthusiasts passionate about observing and understanding Earth from space. Although I didn’t spend every hour in sessions, the moments I did were rich and illuminating, both technically and emotionally. This blog is my way of archiving a few reflections, for future me, and for anyone curious about where Earth observation is heading.
The name “Living Planet” truly resonates once you’re inside the venue. I found myself surrounded by images of clouds, oceans, forests, lightning flashes, not just as art, but as data, signals, and science in action. ESA’s 2040 vision and commitment to societal impact felt more tangible than abstract. It’s not just satellites in orbit; it's a dynamic, collective effort to observe, learn, and act on what we see from space.
From MTG to EarthCARE, from all-sky lightning data to broadband radiometry, I could feel how far Earth science has come—and how far we aim to go.
One major highlight for me was learning more about Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) and the upcoming Infrared Sounder (IRS). Launches are scheduled for July 2025 and March 2026, and they’ll bring higher-frequency, denser observations to track deep convection, especially severe storms.
Some amazing products include all-sky retrievals of temperature, humidity, and ozone; lightning imagers and sandwich products to watch convection evolve in near-real time; and statistical retrievals for clouds and surface parameters. With such tools, we’re on the brink of observing storms almost as they form.

The EarthCARE mission is something I’ve followed for a while, but it felt different seeing it discussed with such clarity. The synergy between radar, lidar, and imagers allows us to create 3D maps of clouds, aerosols, and radiative transfer, crucial ingredients for weather forecasting and climate modeling.

I was especially interested in how these vertical profiles can be used to validate satellite products and feed into NWP models like those at ECMWF. These aren’t distant goals, they’re already part of planning and testing campaigns.

One session I attended focused on open-source tools and data visualization for Earth observation. It was like walking through a digital playground. I discovered EODash, a global EO dashboard where users can even contribute. Ocean Virtual Lab and Xcube viewers turn data cubes into interactive Earth stories. WorldCereal shows crops at global scales—practical even for local agriculture work in Lebanon. I found myself jotting down names and GitHubs, like Maximillian Söschtig’s work on Lexcube, and exploring ESA’s entire ecosystem of EO platforms.

One takeaway: there’s already so much out there—free and public—you just need to know what to search for.

The final day dipped into explainable AI, a growing field bridging physics and machine learning. Talks explored neural networks replacing radiative transfer models, saliency maps explaining SAR signals, and disentangled representations that might help us interpret satellite data better.
Much of my time was spent not in lecture halls but in conversations. I learned about the European Severe Storms Lab, met people, heard about Jupyter GIS, and got inspired to explore environmental issues in Lebanon using EO tools. The mix of operational users, scientists, students, and mission designers was energizing.
ESA’s ability to combine engineering, science, strategy, and society is what made this event so memorable.
Attending even just a few sessions each day reminded me why I love this field. It’s not just about pixels, algorithms, or weather models. It’s about understanding our living planet, with all its complexity, beauty, and urgency.
Whether you're a student wondering where EO fits in your future, or just someone who looks up and wonders how we predict the weather—know that there’s a community working every day to turn satellite signals into Earth stories that matter.
