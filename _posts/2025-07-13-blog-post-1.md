This year I had the chance to attend the ESA Living Planet Symposium in Vienna, Austria, which I would describe as an inspiring, dynamic, and at times overwhelming event that brought together researchers, engineers, institutions, startups, and curious minds around the big topic of observing and understanding Earth from space.


While I didn’t attend every full day (some were mostly morning sessions and a lot of networking), I walked away with a lot: ideas, connections, resources, and a deeper sense of why I care so much about satellites, weather, and remote sensing. 

In this post, I’ll highlight the key sessions that introduce the European Space Agency (ESA) Conference. This event takes place every three years. I’ll share the insights I gained there. Finally, I’ll include useful resources for enthusiasts who want to explore further.

### Day 1: Get to know ESA

It was a great start for me. The Meteosat Third Generation ([MTG](https://www.eumetsat.int/meteosat-third-generation)) session was the fuel, showing how [Sandwich products](https://user.eumetsat.int/resources/user-guides/sandwich-products-quick-guide), [cloud phase RGBs](https://eumetrain.org/sites/default/files/2023-01/CloudPhaseRGB.pdf), and [lightning data](https://user.eumetsat.int/resources/user-guides/using-mtg-lightning-imager-li-to-track-convective-storms) can help track convection and storm development. What’s exciting about MTG is its high spatial and temporal resolution, which makes it well-suited for observing small-scale convective processes. Next, the conference opening featured leading figures from Austria’s space agency and ESA, who outlined Vision 2040, linking Earth observation, technological innovation, and societal impact for the coming decades. Alongside the mission highlights, I explored analysis tools like DEMIX for elevation models, DOORS from Brockmann Consult, and interactive Jupyter GIS workflows, and found that machine-learning pipelines are now being used to process raw SAR data, which is relevant to my master’s research. I also came across emerging platforms like Intellibee and research centers like Φ-lab and [ESSL](https://www.essl.org/cms/). The day left me thinking about how satellite data open access tools could help address key environmental issues in my country Lebanon, such as air quality or urban development.

### Day 2: Innovative tools & visualisation
It was short for me, as I attended the morning session on innovative tools and strategies for Earth observation (EO) visualisation and outreach. I explored open-source platforms like the ESA EO Dashboard ([eodash](https://eodashboard.org/)), which we can actually contribute to, and [Ocean Virtual Lab](https://www.oceandatalab.com/ovl), which combines data exploration with publishing tools. [Lexcube](https://github.com/msoechting/lexcube) stood out with its 3D Earth data visualisation features, and I noted that many of these projects use TypeScript and integrate with Jupyter capabilities. I also discovered World Cereal, a global crop mapping project useful for agricultural users in places like Lebanon, with public data, GitHub access, and QGIS integration. The session reminded me how much is already available if you search well, and I’ve saved most links and demos in the event gallery for later exploration.

### Day 3: EarthCARE & synergy observations
The focus was on [EarthCARE](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/FutureEO/EarthCARE), where I attended sessions highlighting its synergy of radar, lidar, imager, and broadband radiometer data to observe vertical cloud structures. EarthCARE products were compared to CloudSat and CALIPSO, especially in terms of Doppler velocity and reflectivity, with synergy products aligning well. Retrievals include aerosol and cloud profiles (ice, water, mixed-phase), 3D atmospheric structure, and radiation, that’s useful for climate modeling and NWP assimilation. ECMWF’s use of these retrievals for validation and forecasting was discussed, along with efforts to assess VIS and IR observations against cloud profiles. Tools like MSI and ATLID Level 2a provide detailed parameters like extinction, backscatter, and microphysics. I also joined a session on validation campaigns, aiming to verify EarthCARE products and improve their integration into models.

### Day 4: Meteosat new missions
My day focused on current and upcoming satellite missions, especially MTG and Infrared Sounder (IRS). I learned about the evolution from Meteosat-1 (1977) to today’s MTG program, which includes MTG-S1 (launching July 2025) and MTG-12 (planned for June 2026 on Ariane 6). IRS on MTG-S will offer higher spatial (4 km) and temporal (10 min) resolution than IASI for example, with spectral data key for tracking deep convection and improving nowcasting. The session highlighted all-sky retrievals of temperature, water vapor, ozone, and cloud properties from IRS. Sentinel-4, also on MTG-S1, will provide detailed atmospheric composition data and has been over a decade in the making. I also explored the role of Flexible Combined Imager (FCI), lightning products, and remote sensing tools developed by EUMETSAT for convection tracking and operational forecasting.

### Day 5: Explainable AI & emerging research
Day 5 centered on explainable AI and its growing role in Earth observation. I attended talks on Support Vector Machines, semi-supervised learning, and causal representations like DEAR (Disentangled Generative Causal Representation). Interesting use cases included saliency maps applied to SAR data geometry and neural networks replacing radiative transfer models for cloud property retrieval in missions like Sentinel-4. Presentations from DLR showed how explainable AI is helping interpret EO model behavior, especially in visible and near-infrared data.

### Final words
Looking back at the week, the Living Planet Symposium gave me a lot to think about: from satellites like MTG and EarthCARE, to tools I can actually explore and use, to new ideas in explainable AI. Even though I didn’t attend every full day, I made the most out of the sessions I joined and the people I met. It reminded me how fast things are moving in Earth observation, and how important it is to stay connected to both research and operations. I left with a clearer picture of how my interests in remote sensing, weather, and machine learning can fit into real projects, and maybe even help address local challenges in my beloved Lebanon. 

If you want to get the most out of these gatherings, bring your own research to the poster sessions: they’re an open forum where almost everyone is encouraged to participate, and a poster presentation is often all you need to spark conversations with experts who can help you in your work.
