An atmospheric research engineer that worked in Geosciences in different domain applications.

I began my career in remote sensing for landslide monitoring at Cerema, France, as part of my master’s thesis internship. I investigated the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data and interferometric techniques to monitor the Sechilienne and Charlaix landslides in the French Alps, then authored a state-of-the-art review to support Cerema’s shift from optical sensors to freely available satellite data.

After that, I was eager to explore the geosciences domain and data science, so I joined the SESAR-funded “multi-hAzard monitoring and earLy wARning systeM” (ALARM) project. I investigated state-of-the-art data-driven methods and worked on building a machine-learning-based nowcasting system that made use of multi-input datasets, such as GNSS data, C-band radar, lightning detectors, and local weather station measurements. The local and multi-station models could predict extreme rain and wind events every ten minutes, up to one hour ahead, for Milano–Malpensa Airport, issuing aviation-weather alerts.

For the past two and a half years, I’ve focused on satellite data assimilation for numerical weather prediction systems. I had the opportunity to be part of the FFG-funded project in collaboration between the University of Vienna and Geosphere Austria. In my research, I evaluated visible and infrared radiances from the MSG-SEVIRI instrument under all-sky conditions for the convection-permitting AROME-Austria model, and designed an RTTOV testing environment, a key step toward achieving successful data assimilation.

Across these roles I’ve grown passionate about turning remote-sensing data into insight on the atmosphere. I thrive in the fast-moving space community, transforming information captured from orbit into practical tools.
